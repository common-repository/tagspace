The Tagspace widget lets visitors browse your blog's categories and tags in a dynamic & engaging 3D environment.  

== Description ==

All of your wordpress categories and tags appear to float in the tagspace widget, and they're linked to your corresponding content. Click a Tag & See the Content! 

1. PLACE YOUR MOUSE POINTER OVER THE TAGSPACE WINDOW SO IT'S NOT OVER ANY WORDS. 
2. CLICK AND HOLD MOUSE BUTTON DOWN TO FLY FORWARD. LET GO TO SLOOOOW DOWN.
3. MOVE THE MOUSE AROUND WHILE HOLDING THE BUTTON DOWN AND SEE HOW EASY IT IS TO CONTROL WHERE YOU GO!
4. FLY AROUND FOR A BIT UNTIL YOU SEE A CATEGORY YOU WANT TO EXPLORE
5. LET GO OF THE BUTTON, MOVE THE MOUSE OVER THE TAG AND CLICK!!!

Want your site visitors to stay longer and explore more of your site?  
Want to make it easier for people to explore your categories and tags 
and even begin to get a feel for how they relate to each other?? 
And...do you want to do all this in your sidebar??? Then you want the TagSpace widget.  

Match TAGSPACE to your site's theme. 
The widget name, height, width, background color, text color, rollover color, 
and click color are each configurable via the easy to use Tagspace widget admin panel.

Once installed, all changes you make to your site are automatically and immediately reflected in TagSpace. 

== Installation ==

Upload the folder "tagspace" into your "wp-content/plugins" directory.
Log in to Wordpress Administration area, choose "Plugins" from the main menu, find "Tagspace" 
and click the "Activate" button. 

--Configuration--
From the main menu choose "Design->Widgets."   
Drag the "Tagspace" widget to the preferred position on your sidebar.
Click the "Change" button below the widget to display the configuration menu.
Complete the configuration menu: 

	1. Widget Title  - You can substitute a different title for Tagspace 
	2. Widget Height - Specify the height (ex. 220px).  
	3. Widget Width  - Specify the width (ex. 220px).  

You can specify the background color, category color, tag color, and the rollover color 
by simply selecting the color you want using the Farbtastic 
Color Selectors we've provided.  Or, if you're comfortable with hexadecimal, 
just type in the codes for each color into the corresponding selection box. 

Click 'Save Changes' located below the configuration menu to save your changes.

--Uninstallation--
Log in to Wordpress Administration area.
Choose "Plugins" from the main menu
Find the name of the plugin "Tagspace", and click the "Deactivate" button.
If you were using the widget it will no longer appear, so be certain to review your site.
